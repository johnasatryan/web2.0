    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript has always supported object-oriented principles through **prototypes**. Since ES6, we also have **class syntax**, which makes OOP patterns more readable and familiar to developers from other languages like Java or C#.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we‚Äôll model a **transportation domain**:\n",

    "- **Vehicles** (base class)\n",
    "- **Car** ‚Üí extends Vehicle\n",
    "- **ElectricCar** ‚Üí extends Car\n",

    "- **Airplane** ‚Üí extends Vehicle\n",
    "- **Engine** ‚Üí used by Car and Airplane (composition)\n",
    "- **Driver** ‚Üí operates any Vehicle\n",
